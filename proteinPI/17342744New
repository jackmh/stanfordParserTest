11, HSP27 interacts with CD10.
12, HSP27 has weak association with CD10.
13, HSP27 does not interact with CD10.
14, HSP27 has no association with CD10.

1, HSP27 is not interacted with CD10 and HSP70.
2, HSP27 is interacted with CD10, but not HSP70.
3, HSP27 is interacted with CD10 and RNF7P1, but not HSP70 and foxq1.
4, Interaction HSP27 with CD10 and RNF7P1.

CD10 is an approximately 100 kDa transmembrane metallo-endopeptidase. CD10 is strongly expressed by normal prostate epithelium.
CONCLUSIONS: 
The function of CD10 in prostate cancer is largely unknown. In the C4-2 CaP cell line, CD10 was found to interact with both HSP27 and HSP70.
