The Translin/Trax RNA binding complex: clues to function in the nervous system.
Abstract
Translin and Trax are components of an evolutionarily conserved RNA binding complex. Deletion of Translin in yeast, Drosophila and mouse produces a dramatic loss of Trax protein indicating that its stable expression is dependent on its association with Translin. Analysis of Translin KO mice has revealed multiple behavioral abnormalities and alterations in levels of transcripts encoding synaptic proteins. A confluence of localization, biochemical and RNA trafficking studies supports the view that this complex mediates dendritic trafficking of RNAs, a process thought to play a critical role in synaptic plasticity. However, further studies are needed to define its RNA cargoes, its precise role in this process, and how its binding activity and localization are regulated. Nevertheless, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that the Translin/Trax complex be included among the cadre of RNA binding complexes, such as Staufen and CPEB, that regulate dendritic trafficking of RNA in neurons.
